				<h3>Why the cloud?</h3>
				<p>For me, there are three huge advantages to adopting cloud computing</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rich set of APIs and options to service infrastructure needs</li>
					<li>Scalability and Elasticity</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>Rich set of APIs: I can request almost anything I want infrastructure wise from API, and then use it a
							few minutes later
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This enables me to do nice things like:</li>
							<li>Use ephemeral infrastructure in testing, have a CI system spin up all the required infra, deploy the
								code, then run tests to assert that my applications behaviour is exactly as I want it, then tear it all
								down again. I can set this up to react to actions in github, like opening a pull request, then the only
								human interaction here is to write the code, and push it to git.</li>
							<li>I can spike out any theories I have in the same way, deploy ephemeral infrastructure, or a proof of
								concept, and then use that hardware to prove or disprove my thinking, write up my notes and capture
								evidence, then tear it all down again.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Scalability and Elasticity: In addition to the above, having API's and infrastructure scale
							independently of each other is great for responding to traffic patterns.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Being able to scale out an application to respond to increases is by far the biggest win here for me,
								by having a programmatic way for to monitor and respond to saturation of resources is incredible. I can
								write an application, define metrics by which the application should scale on. On a simple level that
								might be request count per instance, as a rated measurement of capacity per compute instance. From there
								I can define scaling policies which state that I need to provide more compute instances to my
								application should the request count exceed its rated threshold. This means we can reliabily serve users
								traffic, even during high traffic demand periods, like a large scale event. What happens if your
								companies blog or website makes the front page on a large social website, thats going to drive a lot of
								traffic down to your website. In the cloud we can define scaling policies to handle this sudden
								unexpected spike of traffic by adding more instances to the application when those thresholds are
								breached. Without scaling policies our website is going to crumble under the increased load, as
								we saturate compute we end up in a situation where no requests are being handled in a timely manner, as
								we exhaust CPU time through computation and context switching.
